A python fretboard display utility.

Easily extensible by just modifying the script.

Pass "c" on the command line to run as a CLI, else it runs as a GUI using tkInter.

It tries to be intelligent about when to show notes as sharp or flat based on the key.


Also a python tablature creator for getting down ideas. Runs in a terminal
